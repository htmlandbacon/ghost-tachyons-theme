# ghost-tachyons-theme

This is an example of a ghost theme built with tachyons.

[Ghost Blog](https://github.com/TryGhost)

[Tachyons CSS](https://github.com/tachyons-css/)

## Notes

Currently the structure is a bit off. Tachyons is wrapped in the **dev/sass** folder.

## Running

Clone this into your ghost root under **${ghost_root}/content/themes/**.

Currenly there is only sass, for development run **gulp** for a server run **gulp production**.
